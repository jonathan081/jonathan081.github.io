 Purpose: Building the basics of website to learn about css and html coding.

 Files added to site:
 	- index.html: Default page for github site. This page contains links to the
 	  components of the site I made. (I also made an index.html for the
 	  www.eecs.tufts.edu domain that automatically redirects to the github page).

 	- resume.html: Page containing my resume information and has an image of me.
 	  Also uses the bullet class to make use of bullet points made in css.

 	- bio.html: Page containing my biographical information and basic info
 	  about the site.

 	- desktop.css: Style sheet that is used across the site. Declares font for
 	  different classes and also sets the background image to one stored in
 	  the repo.
